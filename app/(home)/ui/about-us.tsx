          On 5th April 2013, r/alevel started as a tiny subreddit where A Level
          students could connect and help each other out. Fast forward to today,
          and we’ve become the biggest A Level community on Reddit.
          <br />
          <br /> Our discussions, study tips, and resource sharing have
          supported thousands of students. We launched our Discord server on
          11th June 2023 and it has over 10,000 members, all working together to
          ace those A Levels.
          <br />

          Join us on this incredible journey!
