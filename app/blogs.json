        "Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 not only sparked international outrage. It also triggered a wave of sanctions designed to weaken the Kremlins ability to wage war against its neighbour.",
        "Russias assets abroad were frozen, its economy cut off from the global financial system, its energy exports targeted.",
        "I can remember Western officials and commentators describing the sanctions as crippling, debilitating and unprecedented. With adjectives like these filling the airwaves, the situation seemed clear. There was surely no way that Russias economy would withstand the pressures.",
        "Faced with the prospect of economic collapse, the Kremlin would be forced to back down and withdraw its troops. Wouldnt it?",
        "Twenty-seven months on, the war rages on. Far from being crippled, Russias economy is growing. The International Monetary Fund predicts that Russia will record economic growth of 3.2% this year. Caveats aside, thats still more than in any of the worlds advanced economies.",
        "Debilitating sanctions have not produced shortages in the shops. Russian supermarket shelves are full. True, rising prices are a problem. And not everything that used to be on sale still is - a string of Western companies exited the Russian market in protest at the invasion of Ukraine."

          "Mr Modi inaugurated a Hindu temple at a controversial site that had been disputed between Hindus and Muslims in January and this was expected to give his party a big boost during the election.",
          "But no one quite expected the BJPs campaign to be as polarising as it was - or for some of the most aggressive comments to come from the very top.",
          "At a campaign rally in April, Mr Modi said: “When their (the opposition Congress) government was in power they had said Muslims have the first right on the nations wealth. This means theyll collect the wealth and give it to whom? To those who have many children. To infiltrators.",
          "Some analysts interpreted the remark as an attempt by Mr Modi to galvanise his conservative Hindu support base.",
          "But looking at the results from some key constituencies – the BJP candidate has lost in the temple city of Ayodhya - it doesnt appear to have had the desired effect.",
          "Questions are now being raised about using the Hindu card as a campaign tool, especially since what it seems to have achieved is the opposite - uniting Muslim minorities against the BJP."

          "While the leaders of the ruling BJP, along with most analysts and pollsters, had for months been predicting an easy win for Mr Modi, the Congress-led opposition block kept emphasising rural distress, inflation and rampant unemployment in its messaging and public meetings.",

          "A 4,200 miles (6,700 km) long march by Rahul Gandhi, a senior leader of the Congress party, that began months before the elections was heavily panned for its timing, but analysts believe it enthused supporters and galvanised party cadres.",
          "The opposition also upped its social media reach and aggressively took on the BJP which has for a long time dominated the digital landscape in India."
