              {/* SECTION DATA */}
              <h3>
                The Pomodoro Technique is all about working in short bursts. You
                focus for 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break, and repeat. Each
                25-minute session is called a “Pomodoro” (it’s Italian for
                tomato—cool, right?).

                  <li>Pick a Task: Choose something you need to work on.</li>

                  <li>
                    Get to Work: Focus completely on your task until the timer
                    goes off.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Take a Quick Break: Chill for 5 minutes—grab a snack,
                    stretch, whatever you need.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Repeat: After four Pomodoros, take a longer break of 15-30
                    minutes.

                <strong>Why It’s Awesome:</strong>
                <br />
                The Pomodoro Technique is awesome because it helps you stay
                focused with short work sessions, making it easier to avoid
                burnout. By breaking tasks into manageable intervals with
                regular breaks, it beats procrastination and prevents feeling
                overwhelmed. This approach also helps structure your time
                effectively and track progress more easily.

                <strong>Tips for Making It Work:</strong>
                <br />
                To make the most of the Pomodoro Technique, cut out distractions
                by finding a quiet space and putting your phone on silent.
                Adjust the timing if 25 minutes doesn’t feel right—find what
                works best for you. You can also use apps like Focus Booster or
                Be Focused to help track your Pomodoros and stay on task.

                Time blocking is about planning your day by setting aside

                Time blocking is awesome because it helps you stay organized,
                preventing overcommitment by keeping you on top of things. It
                boosts focus by allowing you to concentrate fully on one task at
                a time. By scheduling your tasks, it ensures that everything
                important gets done efficiently.

                To make time blocking effective, prioritize your most important
                tasks and give them the time they need. Be flexible—life
                happens, so leave some wiggle room in your schedule. Regularly
                check in and review your time blocks to ensure they’re still
                working for you.
