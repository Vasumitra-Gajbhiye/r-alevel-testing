                <strong>Digital vs. Paper:</strong> You should decide whether
                you prefer digital or paper notes. Digital notes might include
                Microsoft OneNote, Evernote or Google Docs, of which offer
                advantages like eggy, easy organization, searchability and the
                ability to even include multimedia. However, paper notes can be
                much more flexible and can help with retention for some
                students. Make sure to choose what works best for you.
              </h3>
              <h3>
                <strong>Notebooks and Stationery:</strong> If you opt for paper,
                you should invest in quality notebooks and stationery. It&apos;s
                always useful to try different colored pens, highlighters and
                possibly even sticky notes that might make your notes more

              <h3>
                <strong>Layout:</strong> You should divide your page into three
                sections, a narrow-left hand column for keywords and questions,
                a larger right-hand column for more detailed notes, and a bottom
                section for a conclusion or summary.
